> **New VS Code Extension (Beta)**: Prefer a graphical interface? Our new **VS Code extension** provides an easy-to-use native IDE experience without requiring terminal familiarity. Simply install from the marketplace and start coding with Doct Code directly in your sidebar. Download and install the [Doct Code Companion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=doctlm.doct-code-vscode-ide-companion) now.

## What Doct Code does for you

- **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Doct Code what you want to build in plain language. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Doct Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
- **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Doct Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](./features/mcp) can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
- **[Followup suggestions](./features/followup-suggestions)**: Doct Code predicts what you want to type next and shows it as ghost text. Press Tab to accept, or just keep typing to dismiss.

## Why developers love Doct Code

- **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Doct Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
- **Takes action**: Doct Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](./features/mcp) lets Doct Code read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use _your_ custom developer tooling.
- **Unix philosophy**: Doct Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | doct -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` _works_. Your CI can run `doct -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
